  # also to address a minimalistic approach 
  # this one feels like it should be fairly straight forward. looking up a few builtins
  
  # initial thoughts were to use a min on the ingredients against an element vs 0 and use a single for loop to make sure i am only looping on a low factor
  # but it seems that using a division i may need to fix up the return maybe floor or int()
  # return min(ingredients.get(elem, 0) / num for elem, num in recipe.items()) # FIXME: possibly cast to int?
  
  # testing with int variation casting the division in to an int for the return as it seems that we get a 2.5 at times which was failing
  return min(int(ingredients.get(elem, 0) / num) for elem, num in recipe.items()) # fixed passing!
