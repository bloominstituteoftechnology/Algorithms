# Climbing Stairs

Imagine a small child ascending a staircase that has `n` steps. The child can hop either 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time. Implement a function `climbing_stairs` that counts the number of possible ways in which the child can ascend the staircase. 

For example, for a staircase with `n = 3` (the stair has 3 steps), there are 4 possible ways for the child to ascend the staircase:

 1. They can jump 3 hops of 1 step
 2. They can go up 1 step, followed by a jump of 2 steps
 3. They can jump up 2 steps, then go up the last step
 4. They can make a single jump of 3 steps

Thus, `climbing_stairs(3)` should return an answer of 4.

## Testing

For this problem, there's a test that tests your implementation with small inputs (n <= 10). There's also a separate test that tests your implementation with large inputs (n >= 50). 

You'll find that without implementing performance optimizations into your solution, your solution will likely hang on the large input test. 

To run the tests separately, run `python test_climbing_stairs.py -k small` in order to run jsut the small input test. Run `python test_climbing_stairs.py -k large` to execute just the large input test. If you want to run both tests, just run `python test_climbing_stairs.py`.

You can also test your implementation manually by executing `python climbing_stairs.py [n]`.

## Hints

 * Since this question is asking you to generate a bunch of possible permutations, you'll probably want to use recursion for this.
 * Think about base cases that we would want our recursive function to stop recursing on. How many ways are there to climb 0 stairs? What about a negative number of stairs? 
 * Once we've established some base cases, how can we recursively call our function such that we move towards one or more of these base cases?
 * As far as performance optimizations go, caching/memoization might be one avenue we could go down? How should we make a cache available to our recursive function through multiple recursive calls?
